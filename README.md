# Forecasting Flight Delay Project

## I. Description
- Developing an end to end Data Intensive Application (DIA) that predicts flight delays using 6 years of US flight recording data along with  hourly weather reports.

Below are the illustrations of the different activities that factor into the total amount of time required for a flight and whether a given flight adheres to its scheduled departure and arrival times as well as the familiar process and tech stack
